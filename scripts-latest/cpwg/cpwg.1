.Sh NAME
.Nm cpwg
.Nd cheap password generator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op nolc
.Op nouc
.Op nunum
.Op nospec
.Op len
.Sh DESCRIPTION
By default,
.Nm
generates a 32 characters long random password,
including lower and upper case letters,
numbers and a subset of ascii special characters.
.Pp
It has been made to be very simple and available in minimal
(say Busybox) environments with my own
.Xr ccrypt 1
based password manager.
This comes at the cost of features,
notably some proper entropy is not granted.
.Pp
Options can be put in whatever order you want to:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm nolc
Do not use lowercase letters
.It Cm nouc
Do not use uppercase letters
.It Cm nonum
Do not use numbers
.It Cm nospec
Do not use special characters
.It Ar len
An integer value, setting the password length
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Generate a password:
.Pp
.Dl $ cpwg
.Pp
Generate a 16 characters password,
without lowercase letters:
.Pp
.Dl $ cpwd 16 nolc
.Pp
Generate a 24 characters password without uppercase letters and
numbers:
.Pp
.Dl $ cpwd nonum nouc 24
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dicepassc 1 ,
a standalone passphrase generator.
.Sh BUGS
I would have liked to use standard flags for options,
but with
.Xr awk 1 ,
it implies using
.Ql --
which is more annoying in everyday use than this option
handling.
