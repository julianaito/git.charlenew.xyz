NAME
    sdd - safe and simple dd(1)

SYNOPSIS
    sdd input_file output_file

DESCRIPTION
    This script is a simple dd(1) clone targetted at copying img and iso
    files to usb disks with extra features:

    *   Prevent overwriting mounted partition, and as such can save you
        reinstalling your system if you did a mistake ;-)

    *   Display a progress bar like pv does

    *   It can compute SHA256 checksums after the copy is done

    No external dependencies out of Perl are required. It has been written
    for OpenBSD and doesn't try to be much portable (but should on any posix
    system).

EXAMPLE
    sdd installXX.img /dev/rsd2c

    Note that you can use block devices on OpenBSD, it will convert to raw
    devices automatically, which are faster and recommended:

    sdd installXX.img /dev/sd2c

ENVIRONMENT
    BUFSIZ
        Use "BUFSIZ" mebibytes for the read buffer. This is the equivalent
        of the "bs" argument to dd(1). The default is 8 mebibytes.

BUGS
    *   "BUFSIZ" should be "BLOCKSIZE" but it's already used by various
        filesystem utilities and is clashing with mount(8).

    *   The conversion from raw devices to character devices and vice-versa
        is only granted if devices are in /dev -- and is limited to OpenBSD.

TEST SUITE
    A test suite is available, run "./testsuite" as root. It assumes vnd0 is
    not used, and only works on OpenBSD.
