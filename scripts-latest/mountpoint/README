About
=====


mountpoint is an OpenBSD-compatible version of the similarly named util-linux
utility. It allows to check if a given file or directory is a mountpoint.

Some examples:

    $ mountpoint /
    / is a valid mountpoint.
    $ mountpoint -q / && echo "I said / is a valid mountpoint"
    I said / is a valid mountpoint
    $ mountpoint -b /usr/local
    /dev/sd1g

Fetching block devices major and minor is not implemented, you can use stat(1)
for this:

    $ stat -f "%Hr:%Lr" /dev/sd1g
    4:22

Please see the bundled manpage for more informations.


Installing
==========


All you need is a C99-capable compiler

    $ make
    # make install

Installation defaults to /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man/man1.
You may want to check out the PREFIX, MANDIR and BINDIR environment
variables.

Uninstalling is also supported:

    # make uninstall
