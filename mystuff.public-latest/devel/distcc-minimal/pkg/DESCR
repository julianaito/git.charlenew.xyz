distcc is a program to distribute compilation of C or C++ code across
several machines on a network. distcc should always generate the same
results as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and is often
two or more times faster than a local compile.

This UNOFFICIAL PORT allows to build a distcc client without needing to build
GTK, and was solely made to allow building it on my macppc machines faster when
i can't pull the package (python/clang version bumps for example).

Don't forget to remove your COMPILER_WRAPPER line from /etc/mk.conf!
